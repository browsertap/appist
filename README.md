application package manage for mac, windows, and linux.

#### Examples

```bash
appm install chrome@34   # can run on windows, linux, and mac
appm install ie@6        # 
appm publish             # publish a new package
```


#### TODO

- [ ] - run apps in their own container if possible
- [ ] - `install` should take platform into consideration when installing stuff
